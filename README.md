# ðŸŽ‰ City Event Finder

**City Event Finder** is a proof-of-concept web application powered by an agentic AI agent which is programmed to find and curate events in different major Australian capital cities. The AI agent considers both the upcoming weather for the selected city and the upcoming events in that location before making an informed suggestion.

The AI agent relies on SerpApi for event data, and OpenWeatherMap for weather forecasts.
